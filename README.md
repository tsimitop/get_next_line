Get_next_line is one of the first projects at the 42 school.

It is meant to be a function that can be used to read a text line by line.
That means every time it is called it only reads one line and remembers where it left off the previous time
so you can go through the entire text without repetitions or segfaults, and definitely without leaks ðŸ¤“.
